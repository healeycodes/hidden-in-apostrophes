## Hidden in Apostrophes

This is my guess at how Genius encoded _Red Handed_ in their lyrics using different types of apostrophes.

If we encode `cat` (which becomes `-.-..--`) in the source text:

### `Hello '' World, '' no '' secrets ' here!`

we get:

### `Hello ’' World, ’' no '’ secrets ’ here!`

Pretty cool if you ask me.
